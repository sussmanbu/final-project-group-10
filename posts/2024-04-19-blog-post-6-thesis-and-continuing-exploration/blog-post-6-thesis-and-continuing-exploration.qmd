## Thesis

The district with a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students, a higher poverty rate, a higher unemployment rate, a lower percentage of parents with bachelor's degrees, and a lower median income tends to have lower mean scores for both languages and math for all students.

## More Exploration of Independent Variables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cleaned_seda <- read_rds("dataset/cleaned_seda.rds")

selected_variables <- cleaned_seda %>%
  select(mn_score_all, perecd, povertyall, unempall, lninc50all, baplusall)

selected_variables %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Test Scores by Race and Economically Challenged Status",
       x = "Test Score",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
