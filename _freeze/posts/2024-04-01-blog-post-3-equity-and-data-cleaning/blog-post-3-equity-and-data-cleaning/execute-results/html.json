This is not broken down by location yet but we wanted to better visualize the data so we would know how to proceed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  mn_score_all     mn_score_asn     mn_score_blk     mn_score_ecd  \n Min.   :-3.735   Min.   :-2.92    Min.   :-3.40    Min.   :-3.55  \n 1st Qu.:-0.198   1st Qu.: 0.26    1st Qu.:-0.63    1st Qu.:-0.42  \n Median : 0.030   Median : 0.60    Median :-0.45    Median :-0.24  \n Mean   : 0.025   Mean   : 0.59    Mean   :-0.44    Mean   :-0.26  \n 3rd Qu.: 0.249   3rd Qu.: 0.93    3rd Qu.:-0.25    3rd Qu.:-0.08  \n Max.   : 2.865   Max.   : 2.79    Max.   : 1.16    Max.   : 1.24  \n NA's   :23209    NA's   :204226   NA's   :180011   NA's   :61878  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nOur next step for Data Cleaning process is to analyze the histograms for selected variables.By examining these histograms, we can visually analyze the distribution of test scores within each subgroup. This visualization helps in understanding the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers within the test scores across different racial groups and economic statuses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncleaned_seda <- read_rds(\"dataset/cleaned_seda.rds\")\n\nselected_variables <- cleaned_seda %>%\n  select(mn_score_all, mn_score_asn, mn_score_blk, mn_score_ecd)\n\nselected_variables %>%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"score\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = score)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Test Scores by Race and Economically Challenged Status\",\n       x = \"Test Score\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 469324 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-3-equity-and-data-cleaning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdditionally, we need to look at the boxplots of selected variables for the Data Cleaning process. The boxplots of test scores across racial and economic groups reveal outliers, differences in central tendency and spread, skewness or symmetry, disparities between groups, and missing values. These observations guide data cleaning efforts to ensure the reliability of subsequent analyses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvariables_of_interest <- c(\"mn_score_all\", \"mn_score_asn\", \"mn_score_blk\", \"mn_score_ecd\")\n\ncleaned_seda %>%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"score\", all_of(variables_of_interest)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = score, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Test Scores by Race and Economically Challenged Status\",\n       x = \"Variable\",\n       y = \"Test Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 469324 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-3-equity-and-data-cleaning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n----\n\n## Data Equity\n\nThe Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) presents an opportunity to use educational data to benefit all students, especially those from underprivileged communities. Researchers and policymakers can use SEDA as a helpful tool for social justice in education by upholding the principles of beneficence and justice.\n\nIt’s important to prioritize research addressing educational disparities. Our research involves conducting analyses highlighting gaps and identifying actional resource allocation. By focusing on the needs of underserved communities, such research can lead to policy recommendations that impact students' educational experiences and outcomes. Researchers must prioritize analyses that offer tangible solutions to underserved communities, ensuring that the insights gained do not disproportionately benefit advantaged groups. \n\nWe need to ensure that research findings are accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and community members, to enable informed decision-making across all levels of the education system. Restricting access to sensitive information protects the privacy and security of individuals represented in the data.\n\n----",
