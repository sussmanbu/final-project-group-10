Publish site to https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME/ using gh-pages? (Y/n)\n[[OP]] Wait for the process to finish.\nOnce it is done, you can go to the URL it asked you about to see your site.\n\nNote: This is the process you will use every time you want to update your published site. Make sure to always follow the steps below for rendering, previewing, and committing your changes before doing these publish steps. Anyone can publish in the future.\n\n\nCustomize your site\n\n[[OP]] Open the _quarto.yml file and update the title to include your team name.\n[[OP]] Go to the about.qmd and remove the TF’s and professor’s names.\nadd your own along with a short introduction and a link to your Github user page.\n[[OP]] Render the site.\n[[OP]] Check and make sure you didn’t get any errors.\n[[OP]] Commit your changes and push.\n[[OP]] Repeat the steps under Setting up your site.\n\nOnce one person is done with this, each teammate in the group can, in turn, repeat steps 3-7. Before doing so, make sure to pull the changes from teammates before starting to make new changes. (We’ll talk soon about ways to organize your work and resolve conflicts.)\n\n\nStart your first post\n\nTo start your first post first, run remotes::install_github(\"sussmanbu/quartopost\") in your Console.\n[[OP]] Run quartopost::quartopost() (or click Addins-&gt;Create Quarto Post, or use C-Shift-P, type “Create Quarto” and press enter to run the command).\n\nNow you can start working on your post. You’ll want to render your post to see what it will look like on the site.\n\nEvery time you want to make a new post, you can repeat step 2 above.\nWhen you want to publish your progress, follow steps 4-7 from Customize your site.\n\nFinally, make sure to read through everything on this site which has the directions and rubric for the final project."

    "text": "More Exploration\nOur regression model predicts the average test score (mn_score_all) based on subgroup-specific test scores, including those for Asian (mn_score_asn), Black (mn_score_blk), economically challenged (mn_score_ecd), female (mn_score_fem), Hispanic (mn_score_hsp), male (mn_score_male), multiracial (mn_score_mtr), and white (mn_score_wht) students. Each coefficient (β) represents the expected change in the average test score for a one-unit change in the corresponding subgroup’s test score. We anticipate identifying significant associations between subgroup-specific performance and the overall average test score. Our model’s goodness of fit will be evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and the F-statistic’s significance, while residual plots will ensure adherence to model assumptions."

The multiple R-squared value of 0.9997 suggests that nearly all of the variance in the dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variables included in the model, while the adjusted R-squared value confirms this finding, adjusting for the number of predictors. The F-statistic is impressively large at 4.84e+06, with an associated p-value of less than 2.2e-16, providing strong evidence of the model’s overall significance. However, it’s noteworthy that not all coefficient estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level, suggesting that while the model as a whole is highly significant, individual predictors may not contribute significantly to explaining the variability in the dependent variable. Despite this, the model still offers valuable insights into the relationship between subgroup-specific test scores and overall average test performance."

This close alignment indicates minimal discrepancies between predicted and observed values, while the consistent spread of residuals suggests uniform variability across different levels of the independent variables. With no discernible patterns, the model accurately captures underlying relationships without systematic errors, meeting key assumptions of linear regression. However, it’s worth noting the presence of some visible leverage points in the data."

    "text": "Option 1: Stanford Education Data Archive\nhttps://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/\nSEDA is a long-term project working to standardize state test scores in order to make them comparable between states. As each state implements their own statewide standardized tests for each grade level with different scoring scales, it is normally quite challenging to perform a direct comparison of differences between states. SEDA aims to resolve that, with available data on individual school performance all the way up to statewide performance, covering math and reading tests for multiple grade levels. We are thinking we would use district-level data, as that would allow for a lot of detailed work if we choose to focus on a specific region. They also have an extensive file of different covariates for each district with percentages of different racial groups, gender, poverty levels, and other interesting variables. The files are easily accessible and well-documented, with the most recent dataset spanning from 2009-2018 and detailed codebooks available for each geographic grouping level. Their methodology is explained on their website. We downloaded the seda_cov_geodist_long_4.1 and seda_geodist_long_gcs_4.1 files. The initial datafiles are quite large (~700,000 and ~1,200,000 observations, respectively), so even though they are very nicely organized and polished, we were not able to upload them to our repository without some compressing. We were able to collapse each file by year and district. Instead of having an observation for six or seven different grade levels for each year for each district, there was only one observation for each district per year, taking the mean for each selected column across all grades. We also removed some of the variable columns that seemed less relevant to what we were thinking about for potential questions–mostly related to how certain covariates like poverty and race interact and how they might affect test scores. With these edits, we were able to get the files to a size that could be easily shared while still containing huge amounts of relevant information for any potential education inequality related project we might choose to do."

We can utilize this dataset to conduct analysis aimed at understanding patterns of health insurance coverage, identifying populations with high rates of uninsurance, assessing the impact of policy changes on coverage rates, and exploring disparities in access to health care services. Moreover, we can investigate the relationship between health insurance coverage and health outcomes, healthcare utilization patterns, and financial burden due to medical expenses.

Sourced from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), these additions—lninc50all, baplusall, and povertyall—represent, respectively, the natural logarithm of the median income across all datasets, the percentage of parents holding at least a Bachelor’s degree, and the overall poverty rate. This data enrichment is performed with the intention of capturing a more nuanced picture of educational disparities on a state level, year by year. To ensure the integrity of our analysis, meticulous steps were taken to filter out any instances of missing values, thus maintaining the robustness of our research framework.\nAs we stand, the datasets have been methodically merged, organizing the newly adopted variables in alignment with the existing structure based on state and temporal parameters. Preliminary scrutiny of the enhanced dataset reveals promising avenues for exploration. For instance, the incorporation of lninc50all allows us to investigate the elasticity of educational outcomes in relation to median income, while baplusall and povertyall offer a lens to examine the correlation between parental education, poverty levels, and educational equity. As we delve deeper into the data, our next steps will be geared towards applying advanced analytical models to discern patterns and potentially causal relationships. Stay tuned as we continue to unfold the narratives hidden within the numbers, with the ultimate aim of informing policies that bridge educational gaps.\nLink for the new dataset: https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/"

The data is primarily gathered for academic research, policy analysis, and accountability purposes. Researchers utilize it to study educational disparities, policy effectiveness, and the impact of various interventions. Policymakers rely on this data to make informed decisions, allocate resources, and hold stakeholders accountable for student outcomes.

These investigations delve into the significant shifts to remote learning and the associated declines in math and reading achievements, offering a district-level perspective on the pandemic’s profound effects on education. Moreover, by examining data from 7,800 districts, the research explores how income levels, minority status, and the extent of remote instruction have influenced learning losses, shedding light on the complex interplay of external factors affecting educational outcomes during this unprecedented time."

This indicates that individual district demographic factors have similar impacts on test scores regardless of the state’s overall test score level."

From the cobalt peaks representing Massachusetts’s highly educated parents to the navy troughs echoing Mississippi’s economic struggles, each bar tells a story.\nIn Massachusetts, the histogram showcasing parental education is a mountain range of ambition, with a majority of districts featuring a high percentage of parents holding bachelor’s degrees. It’s a testament to the state’s rich educational foundation. Contrast this with Mississippi, where these peaks are notably subdued, hinting at a landscape where higher education is a distant summit for many.\nEconomic disadvantage casts long shadows across the Mississippi graph, where the frequency of high percentages is all too common, a reflection of the hardship many students face before they even step into a classroom. Massachusetts, while not immune to these challenges, shows a distribution with fewer districts at the higher end of economic disadvantage, suggesting a different kind of starting line for students.\nThe racial composition histograms are a mosaic of demographic diversity. Massachusetts’s ‘White’ bars rise high, a sign of racial homogeneity in many districts. Mississippi tells a different story, with ‘Black’ significantly more represented, raising questions about how racial and economic factors interweave to shape educational outcomes.\nPoverty and unemployment in Mississippi seem to walk hand in hand, with histograms skewing towards higher rates than those in Massachusetts. It’s a silent narrative of the daily challenges students bring with them to school, burdens that can weigh heavily on academic achievement.\n\n\nMean Score of MA and MS\n\n\n\n\n\nstate\nmn_score_all\n\n\n\n\nMA\n0.4624010\n\n\nMS\n-0.3302381\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData on the Map:\nAs you can see from the map of Massachusetts and Mississippi, districts with a lower percentage of economically disadvantaged students tend to have higher mean scores, while those with a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students generally exhibit lower mean scores overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Factors\nOur initial focus is on economic variables. Poverty and unemployment, often intertwined, emerge as significant predictors of educational success. Districts with higher poverty rates consistently show lower educational outcomes. This pattern underscores the critical role that economic stability plays in supporting academic achievement.\n\n\nEducational Background of Parents\nAnother striking factor is the educational attainment of parents. Districts where a higher percentage of parents hold bachelor’s degrees or higher often report better student performance. This relationship highlights the cyclical nature of education—where educational advantages and disadvantages are passed down through generations, potentially widening the gap.\n\n\nRacial Demographics\nFinally, the racial composition of districts also plays a critical role in educational outcomes. Our analysis indicates varied performance across different racial groups, with significant disparities evident between and within states. These findings provoke a broader discussion on the intersection of race, education, and socioeconomic status."

    "text": "Discussion\nOur exploration reveals a troubling yet clear picture: socioeconomic factors like poverty, unemployment, and parental education significantly influence educational outcomes in Massachusetts and Mississippi. This underscores the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at reducing educational disparities as a step towards greater social equity.\nThe heart of our analysis was focused on examining if the factors influencing test scores have the similar effect at similar rates across two states with very different overall test score levels. In other words, does the percent of Asian students have the same influence on test scores in a state that has low overall test scores as a state that has high overall test scores? Is the effect dampened by having higher overall levels? Is the same true for the rate of black students? White students? Economically disadvantaged students?"

    "text": "Call to Action\nUnderstanding these disparities is just the beginning. We must now turn insights into action. By supporting policies that target educational equity—such as improving access to quality education, enhancing parental support programs, and addressing systemic poverty—we can begin to close this educational gap.\nWe can see that two very different states have similar effects on test scores from different demographic characteristics. This is promising for a variety of reasons, but most importantly it indicates that nationwide policies are feasible solutions. Even if test scores are at different levels, the same factors are having similar effects on test scores, which means that changing these demographics (like increasing the rate of parents with a BA) will “lift all boats” across the country."
