## Our Data

Our data comes from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA). The purpose of SEDA is to provide comprehensive, publicly available data on U.S. K-12 education academic research, policy analysis, and accountability purposes. It is commonly sourced from for the study of educational disparities, policy effectiveness, and the impact of various interventions.

The data is primarily gathered for academic research, policy analysis, and accountability purposes. Researchers utilize it to study educational disparities, policy effectiveness, and the impact of various interventions. Policymakers rely on this data to make informed decisions, allocate resources, and hold stakeholders accountable for student outcomes.

## Data Files and Variables

* District: geographic school district
* Subject:
    + RLA:  Reading Language Arts 
    + MTH: Math
* Mn_score: Average test scores
* Numstu: number of students
* Per: percentage of students in grade
* Subgroups: 
    + All: all students
    + Asn: Asian students
    + Blk: Black students
    + Fem: female students
    + Hsp: Hispanic students 
    + Male: male students
    + Mtr: Multiracial students
    + Nec: Not economically disadvantaged
    + Wht: white students
* Totenrl: Number of students in grade
* Unempall: unemployment rate
* Snapall: Snap receipt rate
* Single_momall: Single mother hh rate

## Cleaning

* We cleaned our data before importing it, as it was 500mB. We kept the scores for each race and the locations, as we are most interested in those.
* We downloaded the raw data and saved it in the data folder.
* Utilized the dplyr package to:
    + Select relevant attributes for the project.
    + Remove unnecessary attributes.
    + Remove missing attributes.
    + Remove unusual values.
    + Utilized the collapse package to collapse selected variables into their mean, creating one observation per year, district, class subject, and state combination. Previously it was expanded into grade levels, and finding the mean across those for each year allowed for compression of the very large original data set. 
The cleaned data was exported to the data folder.

### Summary of numerical variables

To begin, we wanted to make a summary table of general descriptive statistics for the races included in our data and the economically challenged students to see the variation between their test scores. This is not broken down by location yet, but we wanted to visualize the data better so we would know how to proceed.

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(conflicted)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter, .quiet=TRUE)
cleaned_seda <-read_rds("dataset/cleaned_seda.rds")
summary(cleaned_seda[c('mn_score_all', 'mn_score_asn', 'mn_score_blk','mn_score_ecd')])
```

By examining these histograms, we visually analyze the distribution of test scores within each subgroup. This visualization helps us understand the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers within the test scores across different racial groups and economic statuses.

```{r clean, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter, .quiet=TRUE)
variables_of_interest <- c("mn_score_all", "mn_score_asn", "mn_score_blk", "mn_score_ecd")

cleaned_seda %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "score", all_of(variables_of_interest)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score) & !is.nan(score) & is.finite(score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = score, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Test Scores by Race and Economically Challenged Status",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Test Score") +
  theme_minimal()

```
