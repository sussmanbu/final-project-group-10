# Describe where/how to find data

Our data comes from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA). The purpose of SEDA is to provide comprehensive, publicly available data on U.S. K-12 education academic research, policy analysis, and accountability purposes. It is commonly sourced from for the study of educational disparities, policy effectiveness, and the impact of various interventions.

The data is primarily gathered for academic research, policy analysis, and accountability purposes. Researchers utilize it to study educational disparities, policy effectiveness, and the impact of various interventions. Policymakers rely on this data to make informed decisions, allocate resources, and hold stakeholders accountable for student outcomes.

### Cleaning

* We cleaned our data before importing it, as it was 500mB. We kept the scores for each race and the locations, as we are most interested in those.
* We downloaded the raw data and saved it in the data folder.
* Utilized the dplyr package to:
    + Select relevant attributes for the project.
    + Remove unnecessary attributes.
    + Remove missing attributes.
    + Remove unusual values.
    + Utilized the collapse package to collapse selected variables into their mean, creating one observation per year, district, class subject, and state combination. Previously it was expanded into grade levels, and finding the mean across those for each year allowed for compression of the very large original data set. 
The cleaned data was exported to the data folder.
* Filter Massachusetts and Mississippi Dataset

### Summary of numerical variables
To begin, we wanted to make summary tables of MA and MS's general descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables included in our data sets. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)


cleaned_seda <- read_rds("dataset/cleaned_seda.rds")
massachusetts_data <- cleaned_seda %>%
  filter(state == "MA")
mississippi_data <- cleaned_seda %>%
  filter(state == "MS")

create_summary_table <- function(data, state_name) {
  
  summary_stats <- data %>%
    summarise(across(c(perecd, povertyall, unempall, perblk, perasn, perwht),
                     list(Min = ~min(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                          Max = ~max(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                          Mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                          Median = ~median(.x, na.rm = TRUE))))

  
  summary_long <- summary_stats %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable_Statistic", values_to = "Value") %>%
    separate(Variable_Statistic, into = c("Variable", "Statistic"), sep = "_") %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = "Statistic", values_from = "Value") %>%
    select(Variable, Min, Max, Mean, Median) %>%
    mutate(Description = case_when(
      Variable == "perecd" ~ "Percentage of economically disadvantaged students",
      Variable == "povertyall" ~ "Overall poverty rate",
      Variable == "unempall" ~ "Unemployment rate",
      Variable == "perblk" ~ "Percentage of Black students",
      Variable == "perasn" ~ "Percentage of Asian students",
      Variable == "perwht" ~ "Percentage of White students"
    )) %>%
    select(Variable, Description, Min, Max, Mean, Median)

  
  kable(summary_long, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Variable", "Description", "Min", "Max", "Mean", "Median"),
        caption = paste("Summary Statistics for", state_name))
}


ma_table <- create_summary_table(massachusetts_data, "Massachusetts")
ms_table <- create_summary_table(mississippi_data, "Mississippi")

print(ma_table)
print(ms_table)


```

By examining these histograms, we visually analyze the distribution of each variables. This visualization helps us understand the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers within the test scores across different racial groups and economic statuses.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

variables_of_interest <- c('mn_score_all', 'perecd', 'povertyall', 'unempall', 'perblk', 'perasn', 'perwht')

massachusetts_data %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "score", all_of(variables_of_interest)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score) & !is.nan(score) & is.finite(score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = score, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "MA Distribution of Different Variables",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Test Score") +
  theme_minimal()

mississippi_data %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "score", all_of(variables_of_interest)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score) & !is.nan(score) & is.finite(score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = score, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "MS Distribution of Different Variables",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Test Score") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Second Dataset (Adding more variables)

* Newly added key variables to the educational data: median income (log-transformed), parental education level, and poverty rate.
* Data from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) enriches state-level analysis over time.
* Rigorous data cleaning ensures analysis integrity by removing instances with missing values.
* Meticulous merging aligns new variables with existing data by state and year.
