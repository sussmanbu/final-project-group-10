## Introduction

Imagine two children, one in Massachusetts, the richest state in terms of educational attainment, and the other in Mississippi, ranked lowest on the same scale.
Though separated by over a thousand miles, the distance is more than geographical—it's educational, economic, and deeply rooted in the very fabric of society.
This article dives into the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors that shape educational outcomes, revealing how deeply inequality is entrenched from one generation to the next.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thesis Statement

In Massachusetts and Mississippi, the chasm in educational outcomes extends beyond mere geography and taps directly into profound socioeconomic disparities.
Our analysis, focusing on district-level data, demonstrates a stark correlation: in areas where economic disadvantage is more pronounced, educational performance, particularly in language and math, significantly declines.

In the second part of our analysis, we document that most of the factors influencing test scores have relatively similar impact estimates in both states.
This indicates that individual district demographic factors have similar impacts on test scores regardless of the state's overall test score level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data and Methodology

Our study utilizes a comprehensive data set encompassing district-level information from both states, including metrics on economically disadvantaged students, poverty rates, unemployment levels, median income, parental educational attainment, and racial demographics.
By analyzing these variables, we aim to paint a detailed picture of how socioeconomic factors influence student performance across diverse communities.

As we journey through the educational terrain of Massachusetts and Mississippi, the contrasts are as stark as the shades of blue that paint our histograms.
From the cobalt peaks representing Massachusetts's highly educated parents to the navy troughs echoing Mississippi's economic struggles, each bar tells a story.

In Massachusetts, the histogram showcasing parental education is a mountain range of ambition, with a majority of districts featuring a high percentage of parents holding bachelor's degrees.
It’s a testament to the state's rich educational foundation.
Contrast this with Mississippi, where these peaks are notably subdued, hinting at a landscape where higher education is a distant summit for many.

Economic disadvantage casts long shadows across the Mississippi graph, where the frequency of high percentages is all too common, a reflection of the hardship many students face before they even step into a classroom.
Massachusetts, while not immune to these challenges, shows a distribution with fewer districts at the higher end of economic disadvantage, suggesting a different kind of starting line for students.

The racial composition histograms are a mosaic of demographic diversity.
Massachusetts’s 'White' bars rise high, a sign of racial homogeneity in many districts.
Mississippi tells a different story, with 'Black' significantly more represented, raising questions about how racial and economic factors interweave to shape educational outcomes.

Poverty and unemployment in Mississippi seem to walk hand in hand, with histograms skewing towards higher rates than those in Massachusetts.
It's a silent narrative of the daily challenges students bring with them to school, burdens that can weigh heavily on academic achievement.

### Data on the Map:

As you can see from the map of Massachusetts and Mississippi, districts with a lower percentage of economically disadvantaged students tend to have higher mean scores, while those with a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students generally exhibit lower mean scores overall.

### Mean Score of MA and MS

As you can see below, the average score for Massachussetts between 2009 and 2018 is much higher than the average score for Mississippi for the same time.
This leads us to wonder what factors could have caused this to occur

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ma_ms_data <- cleaned_seda[cleaned_seda$state %in% c("MA", "MS"), ]

average_scores <- aggregate(mn_score_all ~ state, data = ma_ms_data, FUN = mean)

kable(average_scores)
```

### Economic Factors

Our initial focus is on economic variables.
Poverty and unemployment, often intertwined, emerge as significant predictors of educational success.
In both states, students whose parents have at least a bachelor's degree receive about a 93% increase in test scores.
Districts with higher poverty rates consistently show lower educational outcomes.
Median income level of the district also had very similar effects in both MA and MS. This pattern underscores the critical role that economic stability plays in supporting academic achievement.

### Educational Background of Parents

Another striking factor is the educational attainment of parents.
Districts where a higher percentage of parents hold bachelor's degrees or higher often report better student performance.
This relationship highlights the cyclical nature of education—where educational advantages and disadvantages are passed down through generations, potentially widening the gap.

### Racial Demographics

Finally, the racial composition of districts also plays a critical role in educational outcomes.
Being white and had a relatively similar impact in both states.
Black students in Mississippi had a lower scores than black students in Massachusetts, although Black students in both states had test scores below the median.
One surprising finding was that being Asian had a much larger impact in MS (356% increase in scores) than in MA (94% increase).
Our analysis indicates varied performance across different racial groups, with significant disparities evident between and within states.
These findings provoke a broader discussion on the intersection of race, education, and socioeconomic status.

## Discussion

Our exploration reveals a troubling yet clear picture: socioeconomic factors like poverty, unemployment, and parental education significantly influence educational outcomes in Massachusetts and Mississippi.
This underscores the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at reducing educational disparities as a step towards greater social equity.

The heart of our analysis was focused on examining if the factors influencing test scores have the similar effect at similar rates across two states with very different overall test score levels.
In other words, does the percent of Asian students have the same influence on test scores in a state that has low overall test scores as a state that has high overall test scores?
Is the effect dampened by having higher overall levels?
Is the same true for the rate of black students?
White students?
Economically disadvantaged students?

## Call to Action

Understanding these disparities is just the beginning.
We must now turn insights into action.
By supporting policies that target educational equity—such as improving access to quality education, enhancing parental support programs, and addressing systemic poverty—we can begin to close this educational gap.

We can see that two very different states have similar effects on test scores from different demographic characteristics.
This is promising for a variety of reasons, but most importantly it indicates that nationwide policies are feasible solutions.
Even if test scores are at different levels, the same factors are having similar effects on test scores, which means that changing these demographics (like increasing the rate of parents with a BA) will "lift all boats" across the country.
