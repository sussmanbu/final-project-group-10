![](images/Big picture page1.jpg)
Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this pge should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.

# From Bay State to Magnolia State: Unveiling the Education Gap Between Massachusetts and Mississippi

## Introduction
Imagine two children, one in Massachusetts, the richest state in terms of educational attainment, and the other in Mississippi, ranked lowest on the same scale. Though separated by over a thousand miles, the distance is more than geographical—it's educational, economic, and deeply rooted in the very fabric of society. This article dives into the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors that shape educational outcomes, revealing how deeply inequality is entrenched from one generation to the next.

----

## Thesis Statement 
In Massachusetts and Mississippi, the chasm in educational outcomes extends beyond mere geography and taps directly into profound socioeconomic disparities. Our analysis, focusing on district-level data, demonstrates a stark correlation: in areas where economic disadvantage is more pronounced, educational performance, particularly in language and math, significantly declines.

----

## Data and Methodology
Our study utilizes a comprehensive dataset encompassing district-level information from both states, including metrics on economically disadvantaged students, poverty rates, unemployment levels, median income, parental educational attainment, and racial demographics. By analyzing these variables, we aim to paint a detailed picture of how socioeconomic factors influence student performance across diverse communities.

As we journey through the educational terrain of Massachusetts and Mississippi, the contrasts are as stark as the shades of blue that paint our histograms. From the cobalt peaks representing Massachusetts's highly educated parents to the navy troughs echoing Mississippi's economic struggles, each bar tells a story.

In Massachusetts, the histogram showcasing parental education ('baplusall') is a mountain range of ambition, with a majority of districts featuring a high percentage of parents holding bachelor's degrees. It’s a testament to the state's rich educational foundation. Contrast this with Mississippi, where these peaks are notably subdued, hinting at a landscape where higher education is a distant summit for many.

Economic disadvantage ('perecd') casts long shadows across the Mississippi graph, where the frequency of high percentages is all too common, a reflection of the hardship many students face before they even step into a classroom. Massachusetts, while not immune to these challenges, shows a distribution with fewer districts at the higher end of economic disadvantage, suggesting a different kind of starting line for students.

The racial composition histograms ('perblk', 'perasn', 'perwht') are a mosaic of demographic diversity. Massachusetts’s 'perwht' bars rise high, a sign of racial homogeneity in many districts. Mississippi tells a different story, with 'perblk' significantly more represented, raising questions about how racial and economic factors interweave to shape educational outcomes.

Poverty ('povertyall') and unemployment ('unempall') in Mississippi seem to walk hand in hand, with histograms skewing towards higher rates than those in Massachusetts. It's a silent narrative of the daily challenges students bring with them to school, burdens that can weigh heavily on academic achievement.

## Analysis

### Economic Factors
Our initial focus is on economic variables. Poverty and unemployment, often intertwined, emerge as significant predictors of educational success. Districts with higher poverty rates consistently show lower educational outcomes. This pattern underscores the critical role that economic stability plays in supporting academic achievement.

### Educational Background of Parents
Another striking factor is the educational attainment of parents. Districts where a higher percentage of parents hold bachelor's degrees or higher often report better student performance. This relationship highlights the cyclical nature of education—where educational advantages and disadvantages are passed down through generations, potentially widening the gap.

### Racial Demographics
Finally, the racial composition of districts also plays a critical role in educational outcomes. Our analysis indicates varied performance across different racial groups, with significant disparities evident between and within states. These findings provoke a broader discussion on the intersection of race, education, and socioeconomic status.

----

Our exploration reveals a troubling yet clear picture: socioeconomic factors like poverty, unemployment, and parental education significantly influence educational outcomes in Massachusetts and Mississippi. This underscores the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at reducing educational disparities as a step towards greater social equity.

----

## Call to Action
Understanding these disparities is just the beginning. We must now turn insights into action. By supporting policies that target educational equity—such as improving access to quality education, enhancing parental support programs, and addressing systemic poverty—we can begin to close this educational gap. Let's commit to making a difference, not just in Massachusetts and Mississippi, but across the nation.
